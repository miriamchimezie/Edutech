God-fearing person. He is a very reputable person and all the information 
she has given is true of him. He was my student in Ss Anthony and Jude College,
 Aba. He was also a hostel prefect and also a member of the dance crew.

 <p>I have proficiency in the use of data analysis tools like Microsoft Power Bi, Tableau Jupyter notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib to analyze in a comprehensive dashboard presentation, including
KPI tracking I am also good in the use of data Base management tools like MySQL, Microsoft excel and Access. 
My professional experiences, includes my role as a Data Analysis/Documentation Officer at Masters Energy Oil and Gas Company limited. While working with them I deployed Microsoft Excel and Access in Analyzing the
company’s Big Data. My role as a Station Manager with Beckwith Oil and Gas Limited,
